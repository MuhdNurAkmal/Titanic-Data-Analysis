# Titanic Data Analysis üõ≥Ô∏è

## üí°Overview 

<p align="justify">A comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, including data exploration, cleaning, transformation and visualizations. The cleaned data will be undergoes various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest, to predict survival outcomes. By comparing the performance of these models, I aimed to identify the most effective approach for predicting survival on the Titanic.</p>
